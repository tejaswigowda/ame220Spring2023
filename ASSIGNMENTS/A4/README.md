# Assignment 4
### Due March 15th, before class

## Tasks

1. Start with the code handout and add bottom slide indicators (circles that indicate the current slide and allows you to move to any slide on click).

2. Allow for both sliding and fading transition between slides. This input will be the last entry in the input hash. 

    For eg. 
    - `http://localhost:8080#<comma-separated-list-of-images>,slide` (for sliding animation)
    - `http://localhost:8080#<comma-separated-list-of-images>,fade` (for fading animation)
